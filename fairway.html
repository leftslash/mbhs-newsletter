  <div>If you did not receive a Fairway card and would like one please send an 
    email to the PA and we will get you one ASAP! Families can use the card with each purchase made at 
    <a href="https://www.fairwaymarket.com" target="_blank">Fairway</a> stores and Fairway 
    will give MBHS PA 3% of each purchase in cash!! This is an easy way to support the PA and it 
    doesn&#39;t cost the families anything. All you have to do is remember to give your card to 
    the cashier when you shop at Fairway.
